# JRMPC-Robot-Mind-Code
This is the code in the "MyTeamMind" class which was submitted for the final round of the James Robertson Memorial Programming Competition. 
The idea of this competition was to create an algorithm which determines a path for a robot, which would yield the most points on a complex grid. Every square on the grid had a certain point value, including negative values. The grid also had features such as death squares, which instantly end the run; jump squares, which move the robot a certain distance in one direction; and warp squares, which can teleport the robot to any location on the grid.
This protocol utilizes pathfinding algorithms A*, Dijkstra, and GreedySearch in various situations depending on the context of its position.
